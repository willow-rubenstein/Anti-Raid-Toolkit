# Anti-Raid-Toolkit
Open Source Toolkit For Combatting All Hate Raids On All Platforms

## Modules Being Used On Live Build
- src/chatfilter.py (this filters out non-standard english keyboard messages, working on multi-language support as this would be an issue)
- src/subonly.py (will automatically turn on subs only when you go online+offline)

## Roadmap/Eventual Plans
- Support for all languages
- English bad
- Help with other raid issues as they pop up
