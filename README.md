NOTE: THIS RUNS IN THE CLOUD! THIS IS ONLY THE SOURCE CODE FOR TRUST

DM ME ON TWITTER TO ADD IT TO YOUR CHAT.

## Modules Being Used On Live Build
- src/chatfilter.py (this filters out non-standard english keyboard messages, working on multi-language support as this would be an issue) - CURRENTLY OFFLINE DUE TO CONNECTIVITY ISSUES
- src/subonly.py (will automatically turn on subs only when you go online+offline)
- src/followbots* (this is the entire AWS hook that handles hoss raids)

## Roadmap/Eventual Plans
